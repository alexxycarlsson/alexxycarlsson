# Joke of the year.
"React is like trying to put together a 1000 piece puzzle blindfolded with one hand tied behind your back, while Vue is like receiving a beautifully illustrated jigsaw puzzle that comes with a cheat sheet of where all the pieces go. React is like trying to braid hair with mittens on, while Vue is like using hair extensions that come pre-braided. React is like trying to make a fancy meal with only a spoon and a toaster oven, while Vue is like having a fully stocked kitchen and a personal chef. #teamVue all the way!"
