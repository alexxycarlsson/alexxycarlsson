# Joke of the year.
"Using React.js is a bit like living on your own - at first, it seems like a great idea. You have complete control over your code and can customize everything to your liking. But soon enough, you realize that there's no one around to help you out when things go wrong. And just like with React, you'll spend countless hours debugging and fixing issues that you wouldn't have had to deal with if you had a support system.

But hey, if you're the kind of person who enjoys spending hours staring at error messages and banging your head against the wall, then React.js is the perfect framework for you."
